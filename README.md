## Takeaway:
I love that this article acknowledged one of my greatest concerns as a Computer Science major.  
As I jump from one course to another, I keep seeing new technical terms and concepts that I wasn't taught, but  
still expected to know and understand. I always struggled to find a linear path to learning Computer Science,  
specifically, software development. 

This article outright acknowledges that such a path does not exist and that I have to learn on the go. 
According to the article, it is crucial to have the will and patience to learn, and to learn by actually coding and 
by being proactive in my journey to learn. In other words, I should search for the knowledge, and not wait for someone 
to feed it to me, and I should practice, practice, practice.
