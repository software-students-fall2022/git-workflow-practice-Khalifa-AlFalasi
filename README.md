## Response

I love that this article acknowledged one of my greatest concerns as a Computer Science major.  
As I jump from one course to another, I keep seeing new technical terms and concepts that I wasn't taught, but  
still expected to know and understand. I always struggled to find a linear path to learning Computer Science,  
specifically, software development.

This article outright acknowledges that such a path does not exist and that I have to learn on the go.
According to the article, it is crucial to have the will and patience to learn, and to learn by actually coding and
by being proactive in my journey to learn. In other words, I should search for the knowledge, and not wait for someone
to feed it to me, and I should practice, practice, practice.

## Comment by Professor Bloomberg

I appreciate the mention of **initiative** as a fundamental skill in this article. Every semester, I receive complaints about this course requiring a good amount of self-study. From my perspective, that is by design. Getting trained to dive head-first into technologies we barely understand (but with good documentation to help) is necessary for survival in this field and is the surest way of learning.

PS: I made the link at the top into a normal-looking reference. We don't need to follow[ MLA handbook styles for citing](https://www.scribbr.com/category/citing-sources/) others' works, but we should make links that are readable by humans.
